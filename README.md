**OVERVIEW**
As part of my self-training purpose, I am Md. Rahat Hasan testing few functionalities of “Ecwid” on https://www.ecwid.com/ web application. 
This document serves as high level test planning document with details on the scope of the project, test strategy, test schedule and resource requirements, test deliverables and schedule. 

**SCOPE**
The scope of the project includes testing the following features of ‘https://demo.ecwid.com/’ web application.

From our understanding, we believe above functional areas need to be Tested. 

**TEST ENVIRONMENT:** 
	-Device: Asus VivoBook S14
	-Os: Windows 10 – Chrome, Edge 

**EXCLUSIONS:**
	-All the features except that are mentioned under ‘Inclusions’ 
	-Any third-party features or Payment gateways 
	-Test Automation 

**TEST STRATEGY:**
We have analyzed the “Ecwid” and has understood that we need to perform Functional Testing of all the functionalities mentioned in the above Scope section. 
As part of Functional Testing, we will follow the below approach for Testing: 

Step#1 – Creation of Test Scenarios and Test Cases for the different features in scope. 
We will apply several Black Box Test Designing techniques while creating Test Cases 
	-Equivalence Class Partition 
	-Boundary Value Analysis 
	-Decision Table Testing 
	-State Transition Testing 
	-Use Case Testing 

We also use our expertise in creating Test Cases by applying the below: 
	-Error Guessing 
	-Exploratory Testing 
We will prioritize the Test Cases 

**TOOLS:**
The following are the list of Tools we will be using in this Project: 
•	XYZ Bug Tracking Tool 
•	Mind map Tool 
•	Snipping Screenshot Tool 
•	Word and Excel documents 

**RISKS AND MITIGATIONS** 
The following are the list of risks possible and the ways to mitigate them: 
•	Risk: Non-Availability of a Resource 
•	Mitigation: Backup Resource Planning 
•	Risk: Build URL is not working 
•	Mitigation: Resources will work on other tasks 
•	Risk: Less time for Testing 



**APPROVALS**
Team will send different types of documents for Client Approval like below:
•	Test Plan
•	Test Scenarios
•	Test Cases
•	Reports
Testing will only continue to the next steps once these approvals are done.
